This was my CS230 final project from Spring 2024.
Name: Alex Mazelsky

Description: Uses the 2017 Mass car crash data to demonstrate various data processing abilities.
Allows you to select a town, and view all crash locations on the map. Each datapoint displays the number of cars involved in the crash and the number of nonfatal and fatal injuries.
Next you are able to select multiple towns and view the average and total for those same attributes.
Finally we show two graphs and a table to give a better insight into the data. 

Data: 2017 MA Car Crash Data from MassDOT
As data I am using a modified version of the data found here: https://geo-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/MassDOT::2017-crashes/about
The version of the data included here only has the columns we use in the program, this was done so I could upload the whole dataset here.

Hosted on Streamlit, please let me know if this link is broken. The program may take a minute to load fully.
