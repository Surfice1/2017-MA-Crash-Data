This was my CS230 final project.

Description: Uses the 2017 Mass car crash data to demonstrate various data processing abilities.

Data: 2017 MA Car Crash Data
As data I am using a modified version of the data found here: https://geo-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/MassDOT::2017-crashes/about
The version of the data uploaded here only has the columns we use in the program, this was done so I could upload all 145 thousand entries to git.
